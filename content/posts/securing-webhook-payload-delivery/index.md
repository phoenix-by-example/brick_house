title: "Securing Webhook Payload Delivery in Phoenix"
date: 2021-02-22T14:00:00-05:00
description: Webhook might sound like some scary, exotic term but at the end of the day webhooks are nothing more that a web server endpoint configured to receive HTTP POST requests in some agreed upon format. The concern however is, without any additional security, anyone could discover the endpoint and start sending their own malicious payloads to your web application.
